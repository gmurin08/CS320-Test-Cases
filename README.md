# JUnit-Test-Cases
The code within this repository serves as an example of developing tests for a class using Junit in Java. The project is a mock backend for a mobile app comprised of contact, appointment, and task classes along with associated helper classes for each object. After implementing each class we create a series of test cases with JUnit to ensure that each lass behaved as intended. Adequate testing allows us to ensure that our code is both functional and secure by testing against a variety of scenarios that the could be faced after deployment. For example, a user may accidentally or purposefully enter input that breaks our code. Adequate testing  ensures that input is entered and validated in such a way that it will not open a door for exploitation or cause the program to crash. Having a clear understaning of the users needs is an important first step in developing software followed by creating design documents and implementation. It is important to be thorough in analyzing user requirements early on so as to prevent potential rework at later stages in the process.
